    1. Tried Packages after watching Tutorials from RSL and Guide from Ros WIKI.
       Getting some "CMAKE error" and "Invoking Cmake Failed" //I am able to 
       change my working directory to the catkin workspace its Just CMAKE giving 
       the trouble
       
    2. From the video Tutorials tried the tutorial thing with the hello world 
       and then i heard hello world along with printing my own mesaage with my 
       Name (No errors there working fine) // this was done without using a 
       catkin workspace
